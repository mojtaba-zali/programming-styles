# Programming Styles

programming style is what results from writing programs under a set of constraints. Constraints can come from external sources or they can be self imposed; they can capture true challenges of the environment or they can be artificial; they can come from past experiences and measurable data or they can come from personal preferences. \[[1](https://books.google.de/books/about/Exercises_in_Programming_Style.html?id=A-TMAwAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y)\]

This repository contains the implementation of _Preys and Hunters_ game, using different programming styles. The program itself is a non-interactive and non-competitive game which is modeled after the kids' board game from Ravensburger _"Tempo, kleine Fische!"_. A short description of the game is available [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24658/avanti-mare).
